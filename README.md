## Directories 

The directories include scripts used for the analyses. The scripts perform the following analysis tasks:

**Cell type annotation using SingleR**

**Dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis**

**Cross-species integration**

**Transcriptome mapping use XGBoost**

**Protein activity analysis using Rosa**

The "Function" directories include functions written from scratch that are used in the analyses.
